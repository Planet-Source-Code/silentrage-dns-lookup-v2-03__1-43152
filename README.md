## DNS Lookup v2\.03


</div>

### Description

Performs DNS requests. It communicates with the dns server directly, so that it has full control over the requesting of information. This client supports more records than nslookup and most other utilities I've found. I also have a commandline version in the C section which I've most recently created.
 
### More Info
 
A single window GUI is available for all query and report options.

There's 2 buttons on the interface that are permenantly disabled until future functionality is programmed. Also there is one bug in this version where the time interval field have improperly displayed hours if the value is above 99 hours.

if you click on the 'report' button it will pop up notepad with the formatted report.

This is such a funny question. Side effects? I dunno, stomach aches, rashes, and mild cases of death are all purely rumor. This is a safe product for you to use.
